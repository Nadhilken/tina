# Deployment Instructions for Render

## Current Status
Your application is now configured to work without external image dependencies and should deploy successfully to Render.

## Quick Deploy Steps

1. **Push to GitHub**: Make sure all files are committed and pushed to your GitHub repository.

2. **Create Render Service**:
   - Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
   - Click "New +" → "Web Service"
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Use these settings:
     - **Environment**: Python 3
     - **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
     - **Start Command**: `gunicorn --workers 1 --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT app:app`

3. **Deploy**: Click "Create Web Service" and wait for deployment.

## What's Fixed

✅ **Removed image dependencies** - No more missing image errors  
✅ **Simplified template rendering** - Built-in fallback HTML  
✅ **Enhanced error logging** - Better debugging information  
✅ **Optimized for Render** - Proper worker configuration  

## Features Available

- **Q&A Management**: Backend API for managing questions/answers
- **Health Check**: `/health` endpoint for monitoring

## Testing Locally

```bash
python app.py
```

Visit: http://localhost:5000

## API Endpoints Available

- `GET /` - Main voice interface

## Troubleshooting

If deployment fails:
1. Check the build logs in Render dashboard
2. Verify all files are in the repository
3. Test locally first with `python test_app.py`

## Post-Deployment

Once deployed, test these features:
1. Voice recognition (requires HTTPS - Render provides this automatically)
2. Q&A responses
3. Health check at `/health`
